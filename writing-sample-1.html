                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>Rapid iteration, clear communication, and strong collaboration are vital to the successful development and launch of various games, including Battle Breakers, Paragon, and Fortnite. The scope of this document captures the tools and workflows that ensure Epic's globally distributed teams are always in sync during critical milestones for a successful game launch.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Role Description</h3>
                    <p>While working on this project as a <strong>technical writer</strong>, I captured technical concepts in well organized stories for our target audience.</p>

                    <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Co-authored the whitepaper with the Lead Engineer.</li>
                        <li>Structured the story to appeal to game studios and independent game developers.</li>
                        <li>Established the tone, voice, and style of the whitepaper to clearly and concisely communicate the technical and workflow lessons learned during development.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Excerpt</h2>
                    <p>"In the early days of development on Fortnite, content creators relied on a process developed during the Unreal Engine 3 timeframed called the editor promotion pipeline." ... "As the project grew, turnaround slowed to a point where it could be a week between promotions, and this challenged the collaboration between engineers and content creators. Fast turnaround times are crucial to many Unreal Engine projects because engineers and designers often collaborate on gameplay functionality through Unreal Engine's Blueprint visual scripting system. Iteration is paramount to game development, and bottlenecks in the pipeline of delivering new code to designers result in fewer opportunities to review and improve the quality of the final product."</p>
