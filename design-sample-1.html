                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>This sample demonstrates my skill in narrative design, including the application of the MDA framework. The goal of this project was to build and document Template Islands to show aspiring creators how we build different game modes with the devices, props, and characters that were brought in from Fortnite's BR mode.</p>

                    <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
                    <p>My Narrative Design process on Fortnite Creative's Template Islands was based on combining different devices to create fun <strong>M</strong>echanics, combining mechanics to create engaging game mode <strong>D</strong>ynamics, and utilizing props and characters to ship Template Islands featuring inspiring <strong>A</strong>esthetics. The following is a small sample of what I worked on.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Linked Lake:</strong> As the template's Game Director, I reviewed and approved all the rules, mechanics, and the overall game flow for this template. Additionally, I served as the narrative designer who worked with the art team to refine the fantasy castle aesthetic for creators to get a good idea of how to combine different fantasy themed props to make an immersive fantasy environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vehicle Domination:</strong> As the template's Design Director, I was responsible for ensuring the game was balanced because players must use a combination of air and ground vehicles to capture different points on the map. As the narrative designer on the game, I worked with the art team to establish a winter environment that evokes a snowy battlefield with a fog of war.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create a Dungeon Crawler Game:</strong> As the template's Design Director, I was responsible for ensuring the map was engaging and interesting for players. As the narrative designer on the game, I worked with the lead template designer to develop an aesthetic that evoked a classic Dungeons and Dragons feeling.</li>
                    </ul>
