                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>This sample demonstrates my ability to create a cast of characters, modify a well known setting, and leverage my knowledge of structure to create a plot that keeps a reader's attention throughout the length of the novel. The goal of my personal project, "Seeds of Change," was to write my first graphic novel so that I could adapt my knowledge of structure and form into a longform narrative that I can eventually turn into a game setting.</p>

                        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FYNXS2BB" class="button primary icon brands alt fa-amazon">Read the Book</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Key Narrative Components</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>5 Act Structure:</strong> I constructructed the overall story arc using a 5 Act structure to move my characters through the inciting incident, complication, crisis, climax, and resolution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kishotenketsu:</strong> Inspired by Manga, I leveraged the ancient Chinese poetic form of Kishotenketsu to invent new twists and keep the story interesting within a scene.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jo Ha Kyu:</strong> Inspired by interpretive dance, I constructed the aesthetics of each scene using the aesthetic philosophy of Jo Ha Kyu in order to build a unique environment that constantly changes for my characters to grapple with.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Excerpt from Issue 9: A Moment on the Bridge</h2>
                    <p>This sample demonstrates narrative scripting for my graphic novel, showing how I use voice-over to build character and backstory during a quiet moment over the Hope Memorial Bridge in Cleveland.</p>

                                [PANEL 1] We cut to an exterior shot of the ambulance, which is situated in the center of the column that is being led by the tank. This should be a bird's eye view of the convoy crossing the Hope Memorial Bridge over the Cuyahoga River.

                                [PANEL 2] We see one of the Guardians of Transportation looking over Cleveland as Sal continues his voice over.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>This sample highlights my commitment to complete a novel, which was an experience that leveled up my general storytelling abilities. To keep track of the different throughlines, I wrote the script with Scrivener.</p>
